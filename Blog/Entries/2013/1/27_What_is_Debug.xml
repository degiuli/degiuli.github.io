    <richText>Roughly speaking, it can mean &#x201C;find and remove bugs&#x201D;. My understanding is that debug originally meant that. However, I now consider debugging much more and includes &#x201C;improve code&#x201D;, &#x201C;check code consistency&#x201D; and many others. I understand that debug can be a very powerful tool to help us out to create and optimize good and consistency code and consequently software and products.&#xD;In addition to find and remove bugs, I particularly use debug tools to look inside the code, find dangerous pieces of software, prevent leaks and deadlocks, optimize code execution and memory usage, prevent unhandled exceptions, close security holes.&#xD;My intention with this series is to put all together. I will try to show in next posts tools that can help you in all items.&#xD;&#xD;Go to series home by clicking in the title above. For all next posts of this series, you can do the same.</richText>
